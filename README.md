# HoodGas2017
Matlab processing software

This code processes oceanographic data collected on a NOAA funded cruise to Hood Canal in August 2017. The code merges CTD and GTD data then deconvolves the GTD time series to provide improved estimates of gas tension and dissolved N2 and O2 saturation levels.
